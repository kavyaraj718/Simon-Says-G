ðŸš¦ Unleash the Fun with "Simon Says" â€“ A Classic Game Reimagined! ðŸŽ®

I'm excited to share the launch of my revamped version of the timeless game, Simon Says! Itâ€™s an engaging blend of memory, focus, and quick reflexes, perfect for all age groups!

ðŸ’¡ How It Works:

Players must follow commands only if they begin with "Simon says."
A twist? Commands without "Simon says" are a trapâ€”donâ€™t fall for them!
Break a rule, and youâ€™re out!
ðŸŽ¨ Interactive Mode:

Watch the colors light up in a sequence.
Click the colors in the correct order to progress and score points.
Each round gets trickier as the sequence growsâ€”test your memory and speed!
ðŸŒŸ Whether youâ€™re looking to relive childhood memories or introduce new generations to a classic, Simon Says is here to bring the fun to any occasion.

Curious? Check out the gameplay demo here! ðŸŽ¥
